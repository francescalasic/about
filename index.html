                <h3>Professional Identity</h3>
                <p>My name is Francesca Lasic and I am a young Italian student with a strong inclination for art, technology and design. After completing my scientific studies at high school, I chose to indulge my natural inclination for industrial design by enrolling in a degree course in Industrial Design at the Technische Universiteit Eindhoven (TU/e). This course allows me to explore both the aesthetic and engineering dimensions of design, giving me concrete tools to become a complete designer.</p>
                <p>My school background and my passions have contributed to developing skills that I consider fundamental for a designer. My drawing skills allow me to visualise ideas through sketches, creating an immediate visual and emotional impact.</p>
                <p>I am very curious about materials: I evaluate their environmental, economic and social impact from a circular economy and resource-saving perspective.</p>
                <p>I am interested in emerging technologies because they allow prototypes to be developed quickly, efficiently and innovatively, and I am working to strengthen my skills in programming and integrating these technologies into projects.</p>
                <p>I consider myself an organised person, able to balance study and personal commitments. I love working in a team, because confrontation and sharing ideas are for me the best way to achieve innovative results and enhance individual skills.</p>
                <p>I always welcome constructive criticism: I try to analyse it by reconstructing my design path, to improve myself and learn from my mistakes.</p>
                <p>I happen to have many ideas at the same time and I am learning to select and focus on the most effective ones. I attend to every detail to perfection, even when not strictly necessary. I am learning to better judge when it is time to stop and move on to the next stage.</p>

                <h3>Past</h3>
                <p>Since childhood, I have shown a deep interest in manual and artistic activities. Drawing, painting, sewing, crocheting and modelling with materials such as plaster and clay have always been not only a passion for me, but also a way to explore the form and function of everyday objects. This sensitivity led me to carefully observe everything around me, questioning myself on how to improve what existed, making it more functional and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
                <p>During my high school years, the study of the history of art provided me with an important theoretical basis, refining my capacity for observation and critical analysis. I learnt to recognise the canons of beauty, balance and proportion, which are now fundamental tools in my approach to design. Technical drawing, on the other hand, taught me precision and rigour, qualities that I have integrated into my design method.</p>
                <p>All these experiences naturally led me to choose industrial design as my field of study at university. I see design as a meeting point between creativity, logic and utility. My desire is to design objects that are not only functional, but also able to excite, tell stories and generate a positive impact in the lives of people. This is why I chose to train at TU/e, where I can cultivate my curiosity, deepen my technical skills and develop a comprehensive design approach.</p>

                <h3>Present</h3>
                <p>During my current course at Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, I am building and consolidating transversal competences in line with the ID framework. These competences span several core areas of design. Through significant projects such as Melodoodle and Study Buddy, I have learned and applied the principles of Design Thinking, a strategic approach that puts the user at the centre. I use models like Double Diamond, alternating between divergent and convergent phases of exploration and problem definition, allowing me to move fluidly from idea generation to tangible solutions.</p>

                <p>I am deepening my technical skills by working with technologies such as Arduino and sensors. In Study Buddy, for example, I integrated light, noise and air quality sensors to improve the study environment. My experience in university labs has allowed me to experiment with different materials and techniques, including 3D printing, helping me better understand how technology can support both functionality and aesthetics in design.</p>

                <p>The design approach I am developing is strongly based on user-centred research, which is essential for creating meaningful solutions. I conduct qualitative interviews and structured questionnaires to understand user needs and contexts, applying methods learned in Human-Centred Design courses. I also use techniques such as Wizard of Oz and Think Aloud to gather feedback and refine my designs iteratively, ensuring they respond effectively to real-world needs.</p>

                <p>I’ve worked intensively in multidisciplinary teams, which has improved my communication, ability to compromise, and understanding of role clarity in collaborative environments. I use tools like Trello and Notion to plan and track progress, ensuring timely delivery and team efficiency. Through these experiences, I’m shaping a professional identity focused on aesthetics, functionality, and sustainability.</p>

                <p>I am fully committed to short-term and long-term goals to strengthen my skills and pursue a path consistent with my vision. In the current semester, I aim to deepen my programming knowledge, explore advanced prototyping methods, and stay updated through workshops and seminars. For the coming year, I intend to strengthen creativity, data & computing, and socio-cultural understanding through targeted courses that will further enrich my perspective as a designer.</p>

                <p>Compared to the beginning of my journey, I feel more confident, autonomous, and aware of my abilities. The skills I have acquired allow me to tackle complex problems with method and creativity. I am proud to be able to integrate sensors, programming and design with an overall vision, fuelled by my passion for design and continuous commitment to my studies.</p>

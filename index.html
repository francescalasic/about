                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Since childhood, I've been passionately dedicated to drawing, painting, and various manual activities like modeling with plaster or other materials, sewing, and crocheting. These passions led me to observe the objects around me with curiosity, wondering not only how they were made but also how they could be aesthetically improved.</p>
                    
                    <p>Studying art history in high school further refined my pursuit of beauty, proportion, and creativity. This continuous research motivated me to pursue Industrial Design studies at TU/e, where I've developed the skills needed to approach the design world with an innovative and sustainability-oriented vision.</p>
                    
                    <p>My academic background and passions have developed skills I consider fundamental for a designer. My drawing ability allows me to visualize and develop ideas through sketches, enabling direct interaction with clients and creating immediate visual and emotional impact. My curiosity about materials leads me to evaluate their environmental, economic, and social impact - from raw material sourcing to production processes. I particularly focus on using recycled or recyclable materials within a circular economy framework and natural resource conservation.</p>

            <div class="about-content reverse">
                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>I'm particularly interested in emerging technologies like 3D printing, AI, AR, and VR. These tools allow me to create prototypes quickly and efficiently while enabling innovative design approaches.</p>
                    
                    <p>I consider myself an organized person who can balance study time with personal commitments. I enjoy teamwork because I believe discussion and idea-sharing are the best ways to achieve innovative, quality results. This collaborative approach also helps me enhance my individual skills.</p>
                    
                    <p>I view constructive criticism as an essential tool for professional growth. I always analyze feedback received, retracing the process that led to specific choices to improve my workflow and learn from mistakes.</p>
                    
                    <p>My journey as a designer is an ongoing exploration of how to make our world more beautiful, functional, and sustainable. Each new project challenges me to grow and experiment with fresh ideas, always aiming to make a difference and improve people's lives while respecting the environment.</p>

            <h2>My Design Vision</h2>
            <div class="vision-content">
                <div class="vision-text">
                    <p>My design approach goes beyond aesthetics. It's guided by deep respect for functionality and our environment. I believe every object should meet people's needs without compromising formal harmony or beauty. What distinguishes me is meticulous attention to detail and a critical perspective of the world around me, transforming every small element into inspiration for creative solutions.</p>
                    
                    <p>I see design as a practice that transcends mere aesthetics or functionality: design is a form of communication, a way to tell stories and evoke emotions. Every object, no matter how small or simple, impacts how we live and interact with our environment. I believe the designer's task is to seek creative, innovative solutions while always considering a product's environmental and social impact.</p>
                    
                    <p>I like to think of design as the union of form and function, but also sustainability and social responsibility. I want my projects to address people's concrete needs while respecting our planet and future generations. My design approach rests on three pillars: innovation, functionality, and sustainability. Sustainability must be at the heart of every project - each product should be designed to last, using eco-friendly materials and responsible production processes.</p>
                    
                    <p>Aesthetically, I prefer simple, geometric forms that reference nature and can be appreciated for both their beauty and daily utility. I'm fascinated by using emerging technologies to explore new design methods, creating customized, sustainable products. I'm also particularly interested in eco-friendly packaging design - a sector I consider crucial for industrial design's future, given growing attention to waste reduction and improved material recyclability.</p>

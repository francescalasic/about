                <h3>Past</h3>
                <p>Since childhood, I have been passionately dedicated to drawing, painting, and various manual activities such as modeling with plaster or other materials, sewing, and crocheting. These passions led me to observe the objects around me with curiosity, wondering not only how they were made but also how they could be aesthetically improved.</p>
                <p>Studying art history in high school further refined my pursuit of beauty, proportion, and creativity. In particular, I acquired key tools for my design journey, such as recognizing proportions and visual balance, critically analyzing works of art, and understanding the importance of historical and cultural context. This reflects in my work, which aims to align with today’s needs.</p>
                <p>Technical drawing in high school taught me to represent objects with precision. I developed a rigorous design methodology that helps me transform creative ideas into concrete and feasible solutions.</p>
                <p>My passions, studies, and curiosity about the world of objects naturally guided me toward industrial design. I chose to study Industrial Design at Eindhoven University of Technology. I aspire to become a designer who combines creativity, innovation, sustainability, and functionality to design objects that are not only useful but also capable of inspiring and evoking emotions.</p>

                <h3>Abilities and Knowledge</h3>
                <p>My academic background and passions have developed a range of skills that I consider fundamental for a designer.</p>
                <p>My drawing ability allows me to visualize ideas through sketches. During brainstorming sessions, I actively contribute to the team by turning ideas into images, making the design process clearer and stimulating collective creativity. In a professional context, this skill enables me to interact effectively with clients, creating a strong visual and emotional impact from the early stages of a project.</p>
                <p>My curiosity about materials leads me to evaluate their environmental, economic, and social impact—from raw material sourcing to production processes. I focus on using recycled or recyclable materials within a circular economy framework to conserve natural resources.</p>
                <p>I am highly interested in emerging technologies like 3D printing, AI, AR, and VR because they allow for rapid and efficient prototyping and offer new design possibilities. In Project 1, I contributed to the creation of a wearable device, using color sensors, Arduino, and a custom PCB with optimized components like an ESP32-S3 module, improved energy management, and a simplified LCD screen. These experiences allowed me to apply emerging technologies to create functional, interactive, and user-oriented solutions.</p>
                <p>I consider myself an organized person who can balance study time with personal commitments. I enjoy teamwork because I believe discussion and idea-sharing are the best ways to achieve innovative, quality results and enhance individual skills.</p>
                <p>I view constructive criticism as an essential tool for professional growth. I always analyze feedback received, retracing the process that led to specific choices to improve my workflow and learn from mistakes.</p>

            <h2>My Design Philosophy</h2>
            <div class="design-section">
                <div class="icon"><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i></div>
                <p>My design philosophy goes beyond aesthetics—it is guided by a deep respect for functionality and our environment. I believe every object should meet people's needs without compromising formal harmony or beauty. What distinguishes me is meticulous attention to detail and a critical perspective of the world around me, transforming every small element into inspiration for creative solutions.</p>
                <p>I see design as a practice that transcends mere aesthetics or functionality: design is a form of communication, a way to tell stories and evoke emotions. Every object, no matter how small or simple, impacts how we live and interact with our environment. I believe the designer's task is to seek creative, innovative solutions while always considering a product's environmental and social impact.</p>
                <p>I think of design as the union of form and function, but also sustainability and social responsibility. I want my projects to address people's concrete needs while respecting our planet and future generations. My design approach rests on three pillars: innovation, functionality, and sustainability. Sustainability must be at the heart of every project—each product should be designed to last, using eco-friendly materials and responsible production processes.</p>
                <p>Aesthetically, I prefer simple, geometric forms that reference nature and can be appreciated for both their beauty and daily utility. I am fascinated by using emerging technologies to explore new design methods, creating customized, sustainable products. I am particularly interested in eco-friendly packaging design—a sector I consider crucial for industrial design's future, given growing attention to waste reduction and improved material recyclability.</p>

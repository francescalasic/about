                <h3>Abilities and Knowledge</h3>
                <p>My academic background and passions have developed a range of skills that I consider fundamental for a designer.</p>
                <p>My drawing ability allows me to visualize ideas through sketches. During brainstorming sessions, I actively contribute to the team by turning ideas into images, making the design process clearer and stimulating collective creativity. In a professional context, this skill enables me to interact effectively with clients, creating a strong visual and emotional impact from the early stages of a project.</p>
                <p>My curiosity about materials leads me to evaluate their environmental, economic, and social impact—from raw material sourcing to production processes. I focus on using recycled or recyclable materials within a circular economy framework to conserve natural resources.</p>
                <p>I am highly interested in emerging technologies like 3D printing, AI, AR, and VR because they allow for rapid and efficient prototyping and offer new design possibilities. In Project 1, I contributed to the creation of a wearable device, using color sensors, Arduino, and a custom PCB with optimized components like an ESP32-S3 module, improved energy management, and a simplified LCD screen. These experiences allowed me to apply emerging technologies to create functional, interactive, and user-oriented solutions.</p>
                <p>I consider myself an organized person who can balance study time with personal commitments. I enjoy teamwork because I believe discussion and idea-sharing are the best ways to achieve innovative, quality results and enhance individual skills.</p>
                <p>I view constructive criticism as an essential tool for professional growth. I always analyze feedback received, retracing the process that led to specific choices to improve my workflow and learn from mistakes.</p>

            <h2>My Design Philosophy</h2>
            <div class="design-section">
                <div class="icon"><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i></div>
                <p>My design philosophy goes beyond aesthetics—it is guided by a deep respect for functionality and our environment. I believe every object should meet people's needs without compromising formal harmony or beauty. What distinguishes me is meticulous attention to detail and a critical perspective of the world around me, transforming every small element into inspiration for creative solutions.</p>
                <p>I see design as a practice that transcends mere aesthetics or functionality: design is a form of communication, a way to tell stories and evoke emotions. Every object, no matter how small or simple, impacts how we live and interact with our environment. I believe the designer's task is to seek creative, innovative solutions while always considering a product's environmental and social impact.</p>
                <p>I think of design as the union of form and function, but also sustainability and social responsibility. I want my projects to address people's concrete needs while respecting our planet and future generations. My design approach rests on three pillars: innovation, functionality, and sustainability. Sustainability must be at the heart of every project—each product should be designed to last, using eco-friendly materials and responsible production processes.</p>
                <p>Aesthetically, I prefer simple, geometric forms that reference nature and can be appreciated for both their beauty and daily utility. I am fascinated by using emerging technologies to explore new design methods, creating customized, sustainable products. I am particularly interested in eco-friendly packaging design—a sector I consider crucial for industrial design's future, given growing attention to waste reduction and improved material recyclability.</p>

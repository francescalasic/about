                <h3>Professional Identity</h3>
                <p>My name is Francesca Lasic and I am a young Italian student with a strong inclination for art, technology and design. After completing my scientific studies at high school, I chose to indulge my natural inclination for industrial design by enrolling in a degree course in Industrial Design at the Technische Universiteit Eindhoven (TU/e). This course allows me to explore both the aesthetic and engineering dimensions of design, giving me concrete tools to become a complete designer.</p>
                <p>My school background and my passions have contributed to developing skills that I consider fundamental for a designer. My drawing skills allow me to visualise ideas through sketches, creating an immediate visual and emotional impact.</p>
                <p>I am very curious about materials: I evaluate their environmental, economic and social impact from a circular economy and resource-saving perspective.</p>
                <p>I am interested in emerging technologies because they allow prototypes to be developed quickly, efficiently and innovatively, and I am working to strengthen my skills in programming and integrating these technologies into projects.</p>
                <p>I consider myself an organised person, able to balance study and personal commitments. I love working in a team, because confrontation and sharing ideas are for me the best way to achieve innovative results and enhance individual skills.</p>
                <p>I always welcome constructive criticism: I try to analyse it by reconstructing my design path, to improve myself and learn from my mistakes.</p>
                <p>I happen to have many ideas at the same time and I am learning to select and focus on the most effective ones. I attend to every detail to perfection, even when not strictly necessary. I am learning to better judge when it is time to stop and move on to the next stage.</p>

                <h3>Past</h3>
                <p>Since childhood, I have shown a deep interest in manual and artistic activities. Drawing, painting, sewing, crocheting and modelling with materials such as plaster and clay have always been not only a passion for me, but also a way to explore the form and function of everyday objects. This sensitivity led me to carefully observe everything around me, questioning myself on how
